# ampl

This repository contains AMPL models, data, and commands formatted in the xml format required to submit problems to the NEOS server. Any file suffixed with '.neos' can be emailed or texted either as the body of the message or an attachement to "neos@neos-server.org". The email address or SMS gateway listed in the file should receive the output of running the AMPL code. Alternatively, the file may also be used with an API client to the NEOS server.
